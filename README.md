### Features

### Installation

- Python >= 3.9
- To install Python dependencies:

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

There are 3 scripts: `main.py`, `image.py` and `init.py`.
You have to run each script  manually when you need it. (since it sends HTTP requests every time, I don't want to be burden.)
- `main.py`: It detects created or modified files on `./markdowns/` and sends requests, save the metadata of it. You can `crontab` this, it won't send any HTTP requests it hasn't been changed but it might consume some computing power to hash the `markdown` files.
- `image.py`: It traverses on `./images/` and sends requests, save the `url` of it at `./.images.toml`. It will skip the already saved images.
- `init.py`: It will generate `access token` and retrieve `category` from your blog and make subdirectories in `./markdowns/`.

#### Retrieve Access Token

Briefly, `App ID` and `redirect uri` will be used to get `Authentication code`(or just `code`); `App ID`, `redirect uri` and `Authentication code` will be used to get `Access token`.

To start off, run:

    python3 init.py

You will see prompts and please follow the instructions.

To get `App ID` and `Secret Key`:

1. Go to `https://www.tistory.com/guide/api/manage/register`

1. Fill out your form. 
    
    Please be aware of `CallBack` column to `{blog_name}.tistory.com`, not `http://{blog_name}.tistory.com`, `https://~` nor `https://www.~`.

1. Now you get `App ID` and `Secret Key`. You can check `CallBack` column and if it doesn't follow the `{blog_name}.tistory.com`, you can modify it here.

1. Enter `App ID` and `Secret key` while following the prompts.

1. All the data you input will be stored at `./.env`. If anything went wrong, you can modify the data manually.

#### Category

By running `init.py`, categories will be retrieved from your blog and subdirectories is generated by your blog categories. You just put `markdown` files by your `category`. The script will detect your directory and send a request from it. 

e.g.
1. Put `example.md` in `markdowns/category1/category2/example.md`.
1. `category1/category2` will be your category like: `category : category1/category2`.


#### Write Markdown

Put the meta data on very top of the `markdown` file like:

```
---
title: your_title [Mandatory]
visibility: [Optional]
published: TIMESTAMP (default: current_time) [Optional]
tag: tag1,tag2,tag3 (default: '') [Optional]
acceptComment: [Optional]
---
```

- `visibility` (default: `private`):
    - `public`: `public` or `3` or `공개`
    - `protected`: `protected` or `1` or `보호`
    - `private`: `private` or `0` or `비공개`
- `acceptComment` (default: `yes`):
    - To accept: `yes` or `y` or `true` or `t` or `허용` or `1`
    - To deny: `no` or `n` or `false` or `f` or `거부` or `0`

You will notice that only title is mandatory and not the others. This is the example:

```
# markdowns/category/example.md

---
title: This is my first article!
visibility: public
acceptComment: 허용
tag: my article,first issue
---

And here it is article content!
```

#### Upload Markdown Files

- Put your `.md` files in `./markdowns/`. 
    
    Subdirectories might be auto-generated from your blog categories.
    ```
    markdowns/markdown.md
    markdowns/category1/markdown1.md
    markdowns/category1/markdown2.md
    markdowns/category1/category2/markdown3.md
    ```
- Run:
    ```
    python3 main.py
    ```
- Modified or created files will be detected using `SHA1` checksum at `./.metadata.toml` and it will send requests to modify for modified files and to create for created files respectively.

#### Upload Images

- Put your `image` binaries in `./images/`. 

    - It can have depth like `./markdowns/`

- Run:
    ```
    python3 image.py
    ```

- Uploaded image url will be stored at `./.images.toml` and you can use `url` when writing markdown.

- Recommend to upload images first before writing your markdowns since you need `url` in `![images](url)`.
